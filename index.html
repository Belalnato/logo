					<h1>YOUR WEDDING</h1>
					<p>Looking for a fresh and modern way to share the details of your special day? Then look no further than our FREE wedding websites that match more than 40 of our bestselling wedding invitations. This means you can now easily create an ad-free site complete with online RSVP capabilities and more-and keep it FREE for one year! Plus it's a great way to share sentimental stories and touching photographs with friends and family as you get ready to walk down the aisle.</p>

					<p>In addition to choosing a theme and color scheme, you can also include photo albums, wedding details, journal entries, gift registry information and more. Include a blog so that you can update everyone on your entire experience from the moment the question was popped until the second you return from your honeymoon. And you can also add an unlimited number of photos on any of our wedding websites. This way you can showcase pictures of you and your fianc√©e while the two of you were dating and even snapshots from pre-wedding events such as your engagement party and bridal shower.</p>
					<p>Also, our FREE wedding websites provide the easiest and most efficient way of managing your guest lists for all of your events. So instead of worrying that your guests might misplace your response card or will even forget to call, let your guests RSVP online. After all, it's the most fast and easy way for guests to let you know that they will be attending your wedding. </p>
